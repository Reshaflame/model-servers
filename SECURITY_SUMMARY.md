# Security Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes the security features added to the model-servers project, their purpose, and where they were implemented in the codebase.

---

## 1. Secure Data Download Layer
**Purpose:**
- Prevents tampering, ensures file integrity, and encrypts sensitive files during download (e.g., from Google Drive).

**Where:**
- `src/utils/secure_downloader.py`

**Features:**
- SHA-256 hash verification for downloaded files
- File encryption using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Secure logging of download activities
- Decryption utility for secure files

---

## 2. Authentication and Authorization
**Purpose:**
- Restricts access to sensitive endpoints (e.g., model downloads, uploads)
- Provides user management and role-based access

**Where:**
- `src/utils/auth_manager.py`
- Integrated into `src/utils/flask_server.py`

**Features:**
- User registration and login
- Password hashing (SHA-256)
- JWT token generation and verification
- Role-based access control (e.g., admin, user)
- Decorators to protect Flask endpoints
- Authentication and authorization logging

---

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
**Purpose:**
- Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS, path traversal)
- Ensures only valid, expected data enters the system

**Where:**
- `src/utils/input_validator.py`
- Used in `src/utils/flask_server.py` and can be used in data pipelines

**Features:**
- Strict regex validation for all input fields
- Sanitization of strings to remove dangerous characters
- File path validation to prevent path traversal
- Model input validation (for NaN, inf, extreme values)
- Validation logging

---

## 4. Secure File Storage
**Purpose:**
- Ensures files are stored securely and only accessible to authorized users

**Where:**
- `src/utils/secure_downloader.py` (encryption)
- `src/utils/flask_server.py` (access control)

**Features:**
- Encrypted file storage for sensitive files
- Access control for file downloads/uploads
- File integrity checks

---

## 5. Network Security
**Purpose:**
- Protects the web server from Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and injection attacks

**Where:**
- `src/utils/flask_server.py`

**Features:**
- HTTPS/SSL support (self-signed for dev, can use real certs in prod)
- Request logging (IP, endpoint, method)
- Secure headers (Flask best practices)

---

## 6. Security Logging
**Purpose:**
- Provides audit trails for all security-relevant events

**Where:**
- `data/auth.log` (authentication events)
- `data/validation.log` (input validation events)
- `data/secure_download.log` (download/encryption events)
- `data/server.log` (web server events)

---

## 7. Test Script for Security Features
**Purpose:**
- Allows you to verify security features independently of the model code

**Where:**
- `src/utils/test_security.py`

**Features:**
- Tests authentication, input validation, and file encryption/decryption
- Does not affect model code or data

---

## Integration Points
- **Flask server (`src/utils/flask_server.py`)**: All endpoints now use authentication, input validation, and secure logging.
- **Data download and storage**: Use `SecureDownloader` for any external file fetches.
- **User management**: Use `AuthManager` for registration, login, and token validation.
- **Input validation**: Use `InputValidator` for all user and file inputs.

---

## How to Use
- Run `src/utils/test_security.py` to verify security features.
- Check log files in the `data/` directory for audit trails.
- Use the Flask server for secure file upload/download and user management.
